          <h2>How to Play</h2>
          <p><strong>Number of players: </strong>2</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Layout: </strong>Rectangular board with 2 rows of 6 holes, with one long hole on each side of the rows called the “mancala”
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Initial setup: </strong>4 marbles should be placed in each hole, excluding the mancalas (total of 48 marbles). Players will sit on either side of the board, with their holes directly in front of them and their mancala to the right.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Objective: </strong>End with the most marbles in your mancala
          </p>
          <p><strong>How to Play: </strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              During each player’s turn, they will grab all of the marbles from one of their holes and, moving counter-clockwise around the board, distribute one marble in each succeeding hole until they have no more marbles in hand
            </li>
            <li>
              A player <strong>must</strong> skip over their opponent’s mancala when distributing marbles around the board
            </li>
            <li>
              The game is over when <strong>one</strong> of the players has no more marbles in any of their holes, excluding the mancala
            </li>
            <li>
              The player with marbles left then moves all of their marbles into their mancala
            </li>
            <li>
              The player with the greater number of marbles in their mancala is the winner
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Other Rules: </strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              When distributing marbles around the board, if the player places the last marble in one of their own holes including the mancala, they get to go again
            </li>
            <li>
              When distributing marbles around the board, if the player places the last marble in one of their own holes that was previously empty (excluding the mancala), all of the marbles in the opponent’s adjacent hole are moved into that player’s mancala
            </li>
          </ol>
